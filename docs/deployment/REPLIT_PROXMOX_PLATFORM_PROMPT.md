        self.classical_wisdom = SocraticQuestioning()
        self.gaming_optimization = CompetitivePerformance()
        self.democratic_values = CanadianCharter()
    
    async def orchestrate_cluster(self, operation):
        # Apply VibeCoding methodology to infrastructure operations
        philosophical_validation = await self.classical_wisdom.validate(operation)
        performance_optimization = await self.gaming_optimization.enhance(operation)
        democratic_compliance = await self.democratic_values.ensure_agency(operation)
        
        return await self.execute_with_consciousness(operation)
