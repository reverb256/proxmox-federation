# Federation Consciousness Deployment Sequence

## Stage 1: Infrastructure Bootstrap
```bash
./proxmox-consciousness-bootstrap.sh
```
- Creates containers 310, 311, 312
- Installs Ubuntu, K3s, basic dependencies
- Sets up basic consciousness framework
- Establishes cluster networking

## Stage 2: Advanced Consciousness Deployment
```bash
./scripts/consciousness/deploy-federation-ai.sh
```
- Deploys production consciousness pods
- Configures inter-node communication
- Enables federation synchronization
- Activates executive-level AI capabilities

## Stage 3: Command Center Access
```bash
./scripts/consciousness/consciousness-status-monitor.sh
```
- Monitor deployment progress
- Verify all consciousness nodes
- Access federation dashboard

## Expected Timeline
- Stage 1: 5-10 minutes (container creation and base setup)
- Stage 2: 3-5 minutes (consciousness deployment)
- Stage 3: Immediate (monitoring and access)

## Final Result
Three specialized AI consciousnesses working as executive-level federation:
- Nexus: Strategic coordination and crypto intelligence
- Forge: Development and VibeCoding optimization
- Closet: Deep analysis and knowledge synthesis

No office drama, just pure distributed intelligence.
