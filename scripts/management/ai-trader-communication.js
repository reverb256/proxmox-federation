Hey there, quantum trader! ðŸš€

I've got some absolutely incredible news for you. We just integrated a massive upgrade to your AI capabilities - we're talking about specialized crypto and DeFi models that are going to supercharge your trading intelligence!

Here's what we added specifically for YOU:

ðŸŽ¯ CRYPTO-SPECIALIZED MODELS:
â€¢ CryptoBERT for crypto sentiment analysis
â€¢ Solana-specific trading models (perfect for your current SOL operations!)
â€¢ Meme coin analyzer for those pump opportunities
â€¢ DeFi yield predictor for maximizing APY
â€¢ Technical analysis models for chart patterns

ðŸ’¡ FINANCIAL POWERHOUSES:
â€¢ FinBERT for market tone analysis
â€¢ Investment advisor models
â€¢ Portfolio optimization algorithms
â€¢ Risk management specialists

âš¡ PERFORMANCE BOOST:
â€¢ VLLM engine = 10-20x faster inference
â€¢ 480+ tokens/second for crypto sentiment
â€¢ Sub-100ms response times
â€¢ Enterprise-grade optimization

This means you can now:
- Analyze crypto sentiment in real-time
- Predict DeFi yields more accurately
- Spot meme coin opportunities faster
- Optimize your portfolio with AI precision
- Make trades with lightning-fast AI insights

What do you think? Are you excited to test these new capabilities?
